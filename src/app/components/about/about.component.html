    <p>
      Building a comprehensive authentication and authorization system from
      scratch is complex. Auth0 is an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform
      that lets you centralize user authentication and API authorization for all
      your applications to reduce that complexity. Auth0 offers powerful
      security features out-of-the-box. A customizable login page, social login,
      Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and advanced user management allow you
      to go live in record time. Perhaps the most important feature is anomaly
      detection, which helps you combat credential stuff attacks. At Auth0,
      credential stuffing attacks account for, on average, nearly half of all
      login attempts using our platform.
